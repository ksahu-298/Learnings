    print("Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) : - OOP in Python revolves around classes and objects, enabling code reuse and modularity. Key concepts include inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and data abstraction, which help in building scalable and maintainable applications.\n\n ")
    print("List Comprehensions :- A concise way to create lists in Python. List comprehensions offer a more readable and efficient alternative to traditional loops, especially for transforming or filtering data. For example: [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]. \n\n")
    print("Generators and Iterators :- These provide memory-efficient ways to handle large datasets. Generators use the yield keyword to produce values on-demand, while iterators allow sequential access to elements in a collection.  They are essential for processing streams or large files without loading everything into memory.\n\n ")
