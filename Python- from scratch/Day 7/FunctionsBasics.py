# Functions in python --> A function is a block of resuable code that perform a task.
# It's define by "def" keyword. E.g-
def greet():
    print("HELLO KARAN! DO IT ")
    
greet()

def sum(a,b):
    print(a+b)
    
sum(3,5)
sum(1000,1017738971)

# Why are functions used in programming? Write two advantages. 
'''Functions are used to execute a same block of code multiple times. 
Advantages :-
    a.) Reduce time to write a code
    b.) make code clear 
    c.) Make code easier to understand'''
